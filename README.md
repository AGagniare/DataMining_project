# Data Mining Project

## Introduction
This project is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit to analyze, clean, and visualize data. It also implements clustering algorithms to group similar objects in the dataset.

## Features
- Load CSV data with custom headers and separators
- Display data previews and statistical summaries
- Handle missing values with multiple methods
- Normalize data using different techniques
- Visualize data with histograms and box plots
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) and visualize the clusters
- Provide cluster statistics

## Setup and Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-mining-project.git
